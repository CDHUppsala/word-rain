Handbook
========
This folder contains examples for the Huminfra handbook on the Word Rain (submitted).

We have made a separare folder for these code examples, which means that the search path to the wordrain module is incorrect. Therefore, if you want to run the code in this folder, copy it to one step upwards in folder structure, i.e., to to main word-rain folder, where you find, e.g., visualise_climate_texts.py.
